# OpenSlicer
A portable three-dimensional object slicer in JavaScript


This project contains the source code for my my thesis. The idea is to implement a slicer in JavaScript for FFF printers, so 3D printers with small memory boards can serve a slicer over http.


# Modules
Since a slicer is a fairly large project, it is structured in different modules, that contain different functionality.


# Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/twinone/openslicer-docs).


# Contributing

This project currently does not accept contributions in the form of Pull Requests, but feel free to open an issue.
