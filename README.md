# OpenSlicer
A portable three-dimensional object slicer in JavaScript


This project contains the source code for my my thesis. The idea is to implement a slicer in JavaScript for FFF printers, so 3D printers with small memory boards can serve a slicer over http.


# Modules
Since a slicer is a fairly large project, it is structured in different modules, that contain different functionality.
